# GENERAL  

# 1. Introduction  

1.1 The Airport Authority’s Airport Operations Manual – Airfield Operations stipulates the requirements in the aircraft fuelling procedures, including fuelling and de-fuelling into / from aircraft. A Civil Aviation Department document, CAD 748 Aircraft Fuelling and Fuel Installation Management (Sept 2007), also provides guidance on safety measures during fuelling operations.  

1.2 In the event of a fuel spillage from aircraft, immediate actions should be taken to stop, contain and remove the spilt fuel to prevent any safety hazard and contamination to the environment arising thereat.  

1.3 This part stipulates emergency response procedures required for a fuel spillage incident involving aircraft during servicing or manoeuvring in the Airside Operational Area.  

1.4 Due to impact of fuel spillage on airside operations, fuel spillage is categorised into minor spill and major spill. This categorisation helps to decide if a full response activity is necessitated.   As a general guidance, minor spill refers to spill of or less than 20 litres and not of a running nature.  Major spill refers to spill of more than 20 litres or of a running nature.  

1.5 Equipment for dealing with aircraft fuel spillage at Hong Kong International Airport is provided in Appendix 4A of this Part.  

# 2 Roles and Responsibilities

# Line Maintenance Franchisee
